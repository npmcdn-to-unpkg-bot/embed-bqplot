# Using bqplot in non-notebook, web context

## Description
This directory is an example project that shows how you can embed the widgets in
a context other than the notebook.

## Try it
1. Open a command line in this directory and run `npm install`.  
2. Now open the `index.html` file.  

## Details
If you plan to reproduce this in your own project, pay careful attention to the 
package.json file.  The dependency to ipywidgets, which reads 
`"ipywidgets": "file:../../.."`, **should not** point to `"file:../../.."`.  
Instead point it to the version you want to use on npm.  

(but really, you should let npm do this for you by running 
`npm install --save ipywidgets`.)
